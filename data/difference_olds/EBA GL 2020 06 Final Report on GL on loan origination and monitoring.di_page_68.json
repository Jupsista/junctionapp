  "summary": "The provided texts contain several overlaps regarding credit-granting criteria, particularly concerning the assessment of a borrower's creditworthiness, repayment capacity, and the management of collateral and guarantees. Both the EBA Guidelines and the FIN-FSA regulations mandate that supervised entities consider specific factors during the loan origination process for both consumers and enterprises. These factors include customer acceptance criteria, repayment capacity, collateral requirements, and collateral valuation. There are also overlaps in the broad requirement for institutions to have policies and procedures for accepting, monitoring, and valuing collateral.",

The EBA GL refers to 'customer credit record' and 'Acceptable maximum size of loan to repayment capacity' for consumers, and 'Minimum requirements for revenues, cash flow and financial projections' for enterprises, while the FIN-FSA regulation requires considering 'the borrower's previous repayment performance, current repayment capacity and estimate of future repayment capacity'.

Institutions may exclude situations where purely macro-economic factors affect both the value of the property and the performance of the borrower from their determination of the materiality of such dependence; (b) the risk of the borrower does not materially depend upon the performance of the underlying property or project, but on the underlying capacity of the borrower to repay the debt from other sources, and as a consequence the repayment of the facility does not materially depend on any cash flow generated by the underlying property serving as collateral.",
