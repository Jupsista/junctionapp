  "summary": "The EBA Guidelines on Loan Origination and Monitoring (filename1) detail various assessment requirements for institutions extending Commercial Real Estate (CRE) loans, including the assessment of income-producing capacity, refinancing prospects, borrower's repayment capacity, property cash flow for interest-only loans, and sensitivity analysis considerations. The Basel Framework (filename2) defines 'exposures that are materially dependent on cash flows generated by the property', particularly for real estate, by specifying that the prospects for servicing the loan materially depend on the cash flows generated by the property rather than the borrower's other sources of income. While the EBA GL specifies *how* to assess the income-producing capacity and cash flows for CRE loans, the Basel Framework *defines* a category of exposures based on whether they are materially dependent on such cash flows, and also sets out risk weights for these categories. These two sets of rules are complementary rather than overlapping or contradictory under the strict definitions provided. The EBA GL focuses on the 'how' of assessment, while the Basel Framework focuses on 'what' constitutes a particular type of exposure and its associated risk weighting. Therefore, no direct overlaps or contradictions are found.",
