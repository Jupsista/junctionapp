  "summary": "The original excerpt requires institutions to have adequate IT processes, systems, capabilities, and sufficient and accurate data for statistical model-based valuation or revaluation of collateral. Several related documents touch upon data requirements, IT systems, and valuation methodologies, particularly in the context of credit risk mitigation, counterparty credit risk, or general credit risk management. However, these related texts often focus on specific contexts (e.g., CCR data, specific collateral types under CRR, or data for PD/LGD estimation) or general IT infrastructure, rather than the explicit combination of 'statistical model-based valuation/revaluation of collateral' and the 'adequate IT processes, systems, and accurate data' specifically for this purpose in a general loan origination and monitoring context. Therefore, no direct overlaps or contradictions are identified under the strict definitions provided.",
