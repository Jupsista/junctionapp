  "summary": "The original content from 'Final Guidelines on Accounting for Expected Credit Losses (EBA-GL-2017-06).di_page_66.json' discusses feedback on the EBA Guidelines regarding credit institutions' credit risk management and accounting for expected credit losses. Key themes include the application of proportionality (especially for immaterial/non-complex portfolios and the use of practical expedients) and the consistency of the guidelines with BCBS guidance and IFRS 9/7. The related content from 'CELEX_32023R1803_EN_TXT.di_page_631.json' (IFRS 9) provides specific rules for measuring expected credit losses, including the use of practical expedients and definitions of default, which directly relates to the accounting aspects discussed in the original EBA report. An overlap is identified regarding the use of practical expedients for measuring expected credit losses. The related content from 'CELEX_32023R1803_EN_TXT.di_page_499.json' (IFRS 7) outlines disclosure requirements for credit risk management practices, including how entities determine significant increases in credit risk, define default, and group instruments, which aligns with the original content's discussion about consistency with IFRS on disclosures related to credit risk management and ECL.",

      "excerpt1": "Use of practical expedientsSome respondents considered the guidelines too restrictive on the use of practical expedients. In particular they highlight that practical expedients are restricted to 'smaller and less complex credit institutions', while the general provisions on proportionality extend its application to a broader scope of credit institutions (including smaller and less complex ones), taking into account 'all relevant facts and circumstances'. Therefore, they suggest that the proportionality principle should be applied consistently throughout the guidelines.",

      "excerpt2": "B5.5.35 An entity may use practical expedients when measuring expected credit losses if they are consistent with the principles in paragraph 5.5.17. An example of a practical expedient is the calculation of the expected credit losses on trade receivables using a provision matrix. The entity would use its historical credit loss experience (adjusted as appropriate in accordance with paragraphs B5.5.51-B5.5.52) for trade receivables to estimate the 12-month expected credit losses or the lifetime expected credit losses on the financial assets as relevant. A provision matrix might, for example, specify fixed provision rates depending on the number of days that a trade receivable is past due (for example, 1 per cent if not past due, 2 per cent if less than 30 days past due, 3 per cent if more than 30 days but less than 90 days past due, 20 per cent if 90-180 days past due etc.). Depending on the diversity of its customer base, the entity would use appropriate groupings if its historical credit loss experience shows significantly different loss patterns for different customer segments. Examples of criteria that might be used to group assets include geographical region, product type, customer rating, collateral or trade credit insurance and type of customer (such as wholesale or retail).",

      "explanation": "Both excerpts address the use of 'practical expedients' in the context of accounting for expected credit losses. The original content highlights concerns about the EBA guidelines being too restrictive on who can use them ('smaller and less complex credit institutions') and advocating for broader application based on proportionality. The related content (IFRS 9) explicitly allows entities to use practical expedients for measuring expected credit losses if they are consistent with principles, providing examples like provision matrices, without explicit restrictions based on institutional size or complexity, thereby setting the framework against which the EBA guidelines were being critiqued for restrictiveness.",

      "excerpt1": "Consistency with the BCBS guidance and with IFRSMany respondents recommended that the guidelines should be less prescriptive and worded more like the BCBS guidance or IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 on disclosures. In particular, they mentioned that the use of 'should' instead of the less prescriptive language used in the BCBS guidance creates additional expectations that go beyond the BCBS expectations.",

      "excerpt2": "35B The credit risk disclosures made in accordance with paragraphs 35F-35N shall enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of credit risk on the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows. To achieve this objective, credit risk disclosures shall provide:(a) information about an entity's credit risk management practices and how they relate to the recognition and measurement of expected credit losses, including the methods, assumptions and information used to measure expected credit losses;(b) quantitative and qualitative information that allows users of financial statements to evaluate the amounts in the financial statements arising from expected credit losses, including changes in the amount of expected credit losses and the reasons for those changes; and(c) information about an entity's credit risk exposure (ie the credit risk inherent in an entity's financial assets and commitments to extend credit) including significant credit risk concentrations. (...) 35F An entity shall explain its credit risk management practices and how they relate to the recognition and measurement of expected credit losses. To meet this objective an entity shall disclose information that enables users of financial statements to understand and evaluate:(a) how an entity determined whether the credit risk of financial instruments has increased significantly since initial recognition, including, if and how:(i) financial instruments are considered to have low credit risk in accordance with paragraph 5.5.10 of IFRS 9, including the classes of financial instruments to which it applies; and(ii) the presumption in paragraph 5.5.11 of IFRS 9, that there have been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition when financial assets are more than 30 days past due, has been rebutted;(b) an entity's definitions of default, including the reasons for selecting those definitions;(c) how the instruments were grouped if expected credit losses were measured on a collective basis;(d) how an entity determined that financial assets are credit-impaired financial assets;(e) an entity's write-off policy, including the indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery and information about the policy for financial assets that are written-off but are still subject to enforcement activity; and",

      "explanation": "Both excerpts address requirements for credit risk disclosures, specifically in relation to IFRS 7. The original content highlights feedback recommending that EBA guidelines be less prescriptive and more aligned with IFRS 7 on disclosures. The related content details the specific disclosure requirements under IFRS 7 for credit risk management practices and their relation to the recognition and measurement of expected credit losses. This includes information on how credit risk increases are determined, definitions of default, grouping of instruments, and write-off policies. The general subject of credit risk disclosure under IFRS is clearly a common point of discussion.",
