  "summary": "The provided documents do not contain any direct overlaps or contradictions based on the strict definitions. The primary document outlines the application dates and transitional provisions for the EBA Guidelines on Loan Origination and Monitoring (EBA/GL/2020/06). The related content mentions or refers to these guidelines in the context of other regulatory requirements or supervisory assessments, but it does not specify different application dates, scopes, or transitional arrangements for the EBA Guidelines on Loan Origination and Monitoring themselves. References to the Guidelines on creditworthiness assessment (EBA/GL/2015/11) in the related content are made in the context of their repeal by the new guidelines, which is consistent with the original content.",
