  "summary": "The provided texts discuss the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring and their relationship with other EBA guidelines and national regulations. The source text introduces the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring, outlining their objective to improve institutions' practices in credit granting, risk management, and monitoring, with a focus on creditworthiness assessment and consumer protection. The related content primarily references these guidelines within the context of supervisory activities, such as SREP, stress testing, and the management of non-performing and forborne exposures. While both sets of texts concern credit risk and borrower assessment, they operate within distinct functional contexts: loan origination and monitoring of *new and performing* loans versus the management of *already distressed* loans. Therefore, they regulate different aspects of the credit lifecycle, preventing true overlaps or contradictions under the strict definitions.",
