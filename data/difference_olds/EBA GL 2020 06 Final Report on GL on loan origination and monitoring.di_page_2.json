  "summary": "The EBA Guidelines on Loan Origination and Monitoring (Document 1) outlines the inclusion of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CTF) policies and procedures, as well as environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, within the internal governance framework for credit granting and monitoring. Several related documents reinforce or specify these requirements within broader internal governance and risk management guidelines for credit and financial institutions. Specifically, the 'Final Report on Guidelines on Internal Governance under CRD' (Document 2, page 8) explicitly states that combating money laundering and terrorist financing risk and taking into account ESG risk factors are part of sound internal governance arrangements and credit institutions' risk management frameworks. This creates a clear overlap regarding the mandate for institutions to integrate AML/CTF and ESG considerations into their internal governance and risk management, particularly in the context of credit activities.",
