  "summary": "Both documents address the subject of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) accounting models for credit institutions. The EBA Guidelines introduce the shift to IFRS 9's ECL model and the need for sound credit risk management practices, while IFRS 7 (referenced in the second document) provides specific disclosure requirements for financial instruments under the IFRS 9 impairment framework. There is an overlap in the general subject of ECL accounting and credit risk management, but the first document is high-level context-setting for the guidelines, and the second details specific *disclosure* obligations, rather than the *implementation* or *measurement* rules themselves. Consequently, there are no direct overlaps or contradictions in specific operative requirements, as one sets out a supervisory framework for practices and the other prescribes reporting standards.",
