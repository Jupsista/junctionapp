  "summary": "The original content is the title page of the 'EBA Guidelines on Credit Institutions' Credit Risk Management Practices and Accounting for Expected Credit Losses (EBA-GL-2017-06)'. The related content contains multiple excerpts that explicitly reference these guidelines and impose obligations on credit institutions to manage credit risk, loss allowances, write-offs, and other related processes in accordance with them. While the original content itself does not contain operative provisions, the related excerpts demonstrate how the subject matter of the original guidelines (credit risk management and expected credit losses) translates into concrete requirements for credit institutions. These references indicate that the *subject matter* of the original document is extensively applied and detailed in other regulatory texts. However, since the original document provided is only a title page and does not contain operative rules, there are no 'overlaps' or 'contradictions' as defined, where both excerpts impose *divergent or conflicting rules*. Instead, the related documents consistently *mandate adherence* to the guidelines identified by the original content's title.",
