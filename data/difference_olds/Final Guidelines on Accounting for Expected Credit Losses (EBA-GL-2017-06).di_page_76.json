  "summary": "The EBA Guidelines on Accounting for Expected Credit Losses (EBA-GL-2017-06) discuss the application of practical expedients in a proportionate manner and note the removal of a specific reference to 'smaller and less complex credit institutions' from paragraph 129 to ensure broader applicability of proportionality. Separately, IFRS 9 (EU) 2023/1803 explicitly states that entities may use practical expedients when measuring expected credit losses, provided they are consistent with underlying principles. Both documents address the use of practical expedients in the context of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) accounting, with IFRS 9 enabling their use and the EBA Guidelines providing context on proportionality in their application.",

      "excerpt1": "On the use of practical expedients, the guidelines should be applied in a proportionate manner in accordance with paragraph 17 and 18, which are relevant throughout the guidelines. The reference to smaller and less complex credit institutions for the use of practical expedients in paragraph 129 aimed at providing more guidance to credit institutions on the application of the proportionality approach in that context. However, in the light of consultation responses, the EBA believes that defining further smaller and less complex credit institutions could add more complexity in the guidelines. Therefore, this reference has been removed from the text. In paragraph 129, the reference to smaller and less complex credit institutions has been removed from the draft guidelines.",

      "excerpt2": "B5.5.35 An entity may use practical expedients when measuring expected credit losses if they are consistent with the principles in paragraph 5.5.17. An example of a practical expedient is the calculation of the expected credit losses on trade receivables using a provision matrix. The entity would use its historical credit loss experience (adjusted as appropriate in accordance with paragraphs B5.5.51-B5.5.52) for trade receivables to estimate the 12-month expected credit losses or the lifetime expected credit losses on the financial assets as relevant. A provision matrix might, for example, specify fixed provision rates depending on the number of days that a trade receivable is past due (for example, 1 per cent if not past due, 2 per cent if less than 30 days past due, 3 per cent if more than 30 days but less than 90 days past due, 20 per cent if 90-180 days past due etc.). Depending on the diversity of its customer base, the entity would use appropriate groupings if its historical credit loss experience shows significantly different loss patterns for different customer segments. Examples of criteria that might be used to group assets include geographical region, product type, customer rating, collateral or trade credit insurance and type of customer (such as wholesale or retail).",

      "explanation": "Both excerpts address the use of 'practical expedients' in the context of measuring expected credit losses (ECL) by credit institutions. Excerpt 1 from the EBA Guidelines discusses the application of proportionality to these expedients and mentions the removal of a restrictive reference, indicating that practical expedients are a recognized concept. Excerpt 2 from IFRS 9 (EU) 2023/1803 explicitly permits the use of 'practical expedients when measuring expected credit losses' and provides an example (provision matrix), thereby establishing the existence and nature of such expedients. The EBA Guidelines provide interpretative guidance on the proportionate application of such expedients, which aligns with the IFRS 9 provision allowing their use under certain conditions.",
