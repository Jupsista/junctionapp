  "summary": "The EBA Guidelines on Loan Origination and Monitoring (filename1) and the EBA Guidelines on Management of Non-Performing and Forborne Exposures (filename2) contain several overlaps regarding the ongoing monitoring of borrower creditworthiness, financial information collection, and specific loan types. Both sets of guidelines require institutions to perform regular credit reviews, collect updated financial information, increase monitoring frequency for deteriorating credit quality, and specifically assess repayment capacity for bullet/balloon loans. There is also an overlap concerning the review of guarantors and their creditworthiness.",

Institutions should also perform regular credit reviews of borrowers that are at least medium-sized or large enterprises, with a view to identifying any changes in their risk profile, financial position or creditworthiness compared with the criteria and the assessment at the point of loan origination, as well as reviewing and updating any relevant internal credit rating/scoring.",

[...] The regular assessment of the borrower's repayment capabilities should also apply to bullet loans, because these loans represent a higher level of risk than a loan subject to regular amortisation and also because continuous payment by the borrower of the interest amounts due is not sufficient reason to assume that the final bullet repayment of the loan will take place.",

Institutions should assess risks associated with the refinancing of existing debt, monitoring loans with bullet/balloon repayment terms separately from other loans on a regular basis. They should analyse potential effects on a borrower's inability to roll over/refinance existing debt, and include inter alia a forward-looking macroeconomic outlook and access to capital markets as well as other types of debt structures. Institutions should closely monitor the borrowers' ability to repay or refinance their debts throughout a loan's lifecycle and not just when the borrower is approaching the end of a loan's term.",
