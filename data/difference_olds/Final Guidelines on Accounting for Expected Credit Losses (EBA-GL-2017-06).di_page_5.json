  "summary": "The two excerpts present a clear overlap as the second document explicitly references and reinforces the application of the guidelines introduced in the first document. Specifically, \"Final Guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne exposures\" states that credit institutions should estimate loss allowances for Non-Performing Exposures (NPEs) and Forborne Exposures (FBEs) in accordance with the \"EBA Guidelines on credit risk management practices and accounting for expected credit losses,\" which is the subject of the first document. This demonstrates that the guidelines from the first document are foundational for specific practices detailed in the second, creating a direct overlap in scope and application regarding credit risk management and expected credit loss accounting.",
