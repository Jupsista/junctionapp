  "summary": "The original excerpt specifies the application date for the EBA Guidelines on credit institutions' credit risk management practices and accounting for expected credit losses (EBA/GL/2017/06) as the first accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The related content from '2018_04.m3_en.di_page_23.json' references the same EBA Guidelines and states that they were 'Issued on 12 May 2017' and 'Issued on 20 October 2020, valid from 30 June 2021'. This creates a contradiction regarding the effective application date of the guidelines.",
