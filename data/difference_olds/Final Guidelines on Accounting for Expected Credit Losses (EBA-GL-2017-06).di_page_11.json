  "summary": "Multiple excerpts refer to and mandate compliance with the EBA Guidelines on credit institutions' credit risk management practices and accounting for expected credit losses (EBA/GL/2017/06). These references consistently require credit institutions to apply the practices outlined in these guidelines for various aspects of credit risk management, including loss allowance estimation, write-off procedures, grouping exposures, internal methodologies for credit risk assessment, and common processes/systems/tools/information. This constitutes an overlap as the cited documents mandate adherence to the subject matter of the original guideline.",
