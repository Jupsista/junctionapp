  "summary": "The EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring outline specific financial ratios and factors that institutions should consider when assessing different types of lending, including real estate development, leveraged finance, asset-based lending, project finance, and shipping finance. This involves metrics like Loan-to-Value (LTV), Loan-to-Cost (LTC), Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR), and Leverage Ratio. The related content from the Basel Framework defines several specialized lending categories, such as project finance, object finance, commodities finance, and income-producing real estate lending, and also specifies parameters like LTV limits for various real estate exposures and the calculation of the leverage ratio. While the original document lists *what to consider* (metrics) for loan origination, the related Basel documents provide definitions of these loan types, detailed risk-weighting approaches, and how certain ratios (like LTV and leverage ratio) are to be defined or applied in a regulatory context. This creates overlaps in the specific financial ratios and loan categories addressed, as both sets of documents pertain to the prudential management and assessment of credit risk in specialized lending.",
