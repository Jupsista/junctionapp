  "summary": "The comparison primarily reveals direct references to the 'EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring' in various other EBA and national regulatory documents. These references indicate that the guidelines from the original document are either being operationalized, recommended for compliance, or used as a benchmark for supervisory assessments. No direct overlaps or contradictions in specific operative requirements between the guidelines themselves and the referring documents were identified, as the related documents generally enforce or contextualize the original guidelines rather than creating new, equivalent, or conflicting obligations on the same regulatory subject for the same actor type.",
