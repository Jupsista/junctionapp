  "summary": "The EBA Guidelines on Loan Origination and Monitoring (EBA/GL/2020/06) refer to and provide further specifications on requirements for the valuation and monitoring of immovable property collateral. These guidelines align with and expand upon the monitoring and valuation principles set out in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) and related EBA guidelines. Specifically, both the EBA GL on Loan Origination and Monitoring (implicitly via its table of contents) and CRR, along with other EBA guidance, address the frequency of monitoring, the criteria for valuers, and the general principles for valuation of immovable property collateral.",
