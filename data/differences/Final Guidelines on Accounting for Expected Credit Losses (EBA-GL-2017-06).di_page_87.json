  "summary": "The initial document is a summary of stakeholder feedback and the EBA's analysis regarding the 'Guidelines on Credit Institutions' Credit Risk Management Practices and Accounting for Expected Credit Losses'. This content is explanatory and describes the rationale for the guidelines, but does not contain operative legal requirements. The related documents either reference these guidelines, discuss different regulatory subjects (such as outsourcing, internal governance, or non-performing exposures), or consist of non-operative content like cost-benefit analyses. As there are no two excerpts that impose, modify, or limit obligations on the same specific regulatory subject for the same actor, no overlaps or contradictions were found.",
