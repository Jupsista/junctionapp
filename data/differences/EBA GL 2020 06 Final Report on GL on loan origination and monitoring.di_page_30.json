  "summary": "One overlap was identified between the two EBA Guidelines concerning the internal control framework for credit risk. Both documents require that the function or process responsible for managing and assessing credit risk must be independent from the business units that originate the credit (the lending function). This establishes the same principle of segregation of duties for the same actor (credit institutions) in the same context (credit risk management).",
