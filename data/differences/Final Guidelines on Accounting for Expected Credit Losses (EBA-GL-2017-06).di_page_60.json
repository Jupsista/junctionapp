  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found between the provided texts. The source document discusses options for applying the principle of proportionality within the EBA Guidelines on Accounting for Expected Credit Losses, which is part of the legislative rationale and not an operative rule. The related texts discuss the application of the proportionality principle in different functional contexts, such as the management of non-performing exposures, internal governance, or stress testing. As they do not govern the same regulatory subject, they do not meet the strict criteria for an overlap or contradiction.",
