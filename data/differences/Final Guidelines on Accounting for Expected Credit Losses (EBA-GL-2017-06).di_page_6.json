  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found between the documents. The primary document specifies the application date for the EBA Guidelines on credit institutions' credit risk management practices and accounting for expected credit losses (EBA-GL-2017-06). The related documents reference these guidelines for their substantive content or discuss other regulatory topics, but none address the specific regulatory subject of the application date of these guidelines. Therefore, the condition of regulating the 'SAME REGULATORY SUBJECT' is not met for any comparison.",
