  "summary": "One overlap was identified between the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and the Basel Framework regarding the use of metrics for assessing a borrower's ability to repay. The EBA Guideline provides a discretionary, non-exhaustive list of metrics for institutions to consider for consumer lending, while the Basel Framework makes it mandatory for banks' underwriting policies for mortgage loans to define specific metrics and their corresponding levels. This creates an overlap as they are divergent rules (a guideline versus a standard) governing the same regulatory subject of creditworthiness assessment.",
