  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found between the provided documents. The original document provides background and rationale for the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring, outlining its objective to prevent new non-performing loans (NPLs). The related documents either reference these guidelines as a standard for competent authorities during supervisory reviews (regulating a different actor and action), discuss the management of existing NPLs (a complementary but different regulatory subject), or are national-level documents that incorporate the EBA guidelines by reference rather than setting parallel rules.",
