  "summary": "The provided texts do not contain any overlaps or contradictions. The primary document is a title page for the 'EBA Guidelines on credit institutions' credit risk management practices and accounting for expected credit losses' (EBA/GL/2017/06) and contains no operative rules. The related documents frequently reference these specific EBA Guidelines, mandating compliance with them or describing their content. This establishes a hierarchical relationship of legal reference, rather than presenting separate, parallel rules that could be divergent or contradictory. Other texts apply to different actors (e.g., competent authorities instead of credit institutions) or different regulatory subjects (e.g., supervisory review processes), thus failing the 'same regulatory subject' test.",
