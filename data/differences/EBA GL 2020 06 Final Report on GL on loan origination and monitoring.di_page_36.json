  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found between the provided texts. The original text sets out requirements for institutions and creditors regarding creditworthiness assessments during loan origination, particularly for foreign currency loans. The related texts, while touching upon similar themes like foreign exchange risk and credit assessment, apply to different actors (e.g., competent authorities conducting supervisory reviews) or different functional contexts (e.g., capital requirement calculations, stress testing, or management of non-performing exposures). Therefore, they do not regulate the same regulatory subject as defined by the strict criteria.",
