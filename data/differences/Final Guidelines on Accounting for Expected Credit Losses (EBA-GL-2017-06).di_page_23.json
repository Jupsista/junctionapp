  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found between the provided texts. The documents regulate different aspects of credit risk management or are complementary. Specifically, the 'Final Guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne exposures' references and builds upon the 'Final Guidelines on Accounting for Expected Credit Losses', creating a hierarchical rather than an overlapping relationship. Other documents address distinct topics such as prudential risk weights, stress testing, or loan origination, which are different regulatory subjects from accounting for expected credit losses.",
