  "summary": "Two overlaps were identified where different EBA guidelines mandate that credit institutions use the same definitions for 'non-performing exposures' and 'forbearance' from the same regulatory source (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 and its related Implementing Technical Standards). This ensures definitional consistency across different aspects of credit risk management, including accounting for expected credit losses, management of non-performing exposures, and the definition of default.",
