  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found. The primary document excerpt is from a cost-benefit analysis section of a final report, which contains explanatory language and rationale rather than specific, operative legal requirements. The related texts, while touching upon Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) risks, either apply to different actor types (e.g., insurance undertakings, investment firms, benchmark administrators), different regulatory actions (e.g., public disclosure, internal governance), or are themselves non-operative recitals. As the primary text lacks a specific, binding rule, a comparison for overlaps or contradictions is not possible under the provided strict definitions.",
