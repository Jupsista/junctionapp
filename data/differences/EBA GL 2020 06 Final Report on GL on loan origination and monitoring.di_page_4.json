  "summary": "The analysis identified three instances of overlap between the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring and the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority's regulations. The overlaps occur where the Finnish national regulations explicitly adopt and implement the principles and requirements set out in the EBA Guidelines concerning the credit granting process and creditworthiness assessments for financial institutions. Both sets of documents regulate the same actors (credit institutions) and the same regulatory action (loan origination and creditworthiness assessment). No contradictions were found.",
