  "summary": "The documents do not present an overlap or contradiction based on the strict definitions provided. The primary document, EBA-GL-2017-06, contains a summary of stakeholder feedback which mentions a 'minimum two year' probation period from a separate regulatory text (the ITS on Non-performing loans and forbearance). However, this is not an operative rule within the provided text itself, but a description of a comment made by a third party. Other provided texts, specifically from the 'Guidelines on the application of the definition of default' (EBA-GL-2016-07), establish clear operative rules for minimum probation periods of 3 months for general cases and 1 year for distressed restructuring. As the text mentioning the 'two year' period does not impose a legal obligation itself, it cannot form the basis of a contradiction with an operative rule from another document.",
