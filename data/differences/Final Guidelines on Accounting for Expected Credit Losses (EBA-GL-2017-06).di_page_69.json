  "summary": "The comparison did not identify any overlaps or contradictions between the provided texts. The primary document describes the drafting methodology and legal basis for the EBA Guidelines on Accounting for Expected Credit Losses, rather than setting out specific operative rules. The related documents either reference these guidelines consistently for specific applications (such as for non-performing exposures), or they address different regulatory subjects, such as the prudential definition of default, credit risk mitigation under the IRB approach, or interest rate risk, which are distinct from accounting for expected credit losses.",
