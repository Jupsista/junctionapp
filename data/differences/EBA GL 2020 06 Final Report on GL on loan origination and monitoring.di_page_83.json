  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found between the provided documents based on the strict definitions. The documents address the valuation of immovable property collateral in different functional contexts, specifically distinguishing between general loan monitoring and the management of non-performing exposures (NPEs). While the rules for using statistical models for revaluation differ, they apply to distinct categories of loans (performing vs. non-performing) and therefore do not regulate the same subject matter simultaneously.",
