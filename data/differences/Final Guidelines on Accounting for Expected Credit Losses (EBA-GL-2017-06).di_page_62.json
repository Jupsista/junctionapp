  "summary": "The documents review the scope of application for different EBA guidelines. The 'Final Guidelines on Accounting for Expected Credit Losses' explicitly excludes investment firms from its scope, deeming the requirements disproportionate to the benefits. In contrast, other guidelines, such as those on 'ICT and security risk management' and 'outsourcing arrangements', explicitly include investment firms to ensure a level playing field in those specific regulatory areas. As these guidelines cover different regulatory subjects (credit risk accounting vs. ICT risk vs. outsourcing), there is no overlap or contradiction based on the provided definitions.",
