  "summary": "An overlap was identified between the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and the Basel Framework. Both texts mandate that credit institutions must establish underwriting policies which define specific metrics for assessing a borrower's ability to repay, such as the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR), and specify the acceptable limits or levels for these metrics.",
