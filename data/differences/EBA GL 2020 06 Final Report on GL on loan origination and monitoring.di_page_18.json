  "summary": "The comparison identified one overlap concerning the application date of the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring (EBA/GL/2020/06). The EBA's final report specifies an application date of 30 June 2021. A corresponding document from the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA) mirrors this, stating that the same EBA guidelines are valid from 30 June 2021. Both documents establish the same effective date for the same set of rules applicable to financial institutions, creating a direct regulatory overlap. No contradictions were found.",
