  "summary": "The provided texts describe the standard compliance and reporting obligations for competent authorities concerning various EBA guidelines. Each text outlines the same procedural requirement, based on Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, for a competent authority to notify the EBA of its compliance status with a specific set of guidelines. Although the procedure is identical, the regulatory subject matter to which the compliance notification pertains is different in each case (e.g., loan origination, IPU thresholds, outsourcing). As the rules apply to distinct and separate sets of guidelines, they do not regulate the same subject matter and therefore do not create any overlaps or contradictions.",
