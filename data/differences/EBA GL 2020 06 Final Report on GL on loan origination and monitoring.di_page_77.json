  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found. The original document is a cost-benefit analysis and policy objective statement for the EBA Guidelines on Loan Origination and Monitoring. It is non-operative and does not impose specific legal requirements. The related documents pertain to different guidelines (such as those for managing non-performing exposures or for supervisory review processes), address different regulatory subjects (e.g., managing existing bad loans versus originating new loans), or are high-level policy documents not directed at the same actor type. Therefore, the mandatory condition of regulating the 'same regulatory subject' is not met in any comparison.",
