  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found. The primary document describes the content and purpose of the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring, but the provided excerpt does not contain specific, operative rules. It explains what other sections of the guidelines cover, making a direct rule-to-rule comparison with the related texts impossible under the strict definitions provided. The related texts either refer to these guidelines from a different regulatory perspective (e.g., supervisory assessment) or regulate different subjects (e.g., management of non-performing exposures).",
