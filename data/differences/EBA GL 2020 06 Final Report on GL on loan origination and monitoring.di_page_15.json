  "summary": "The user-provided texts regulate different aspects of real estate financing and risk management. No true overlaps or contradictions were found under the strict definitions provided. The main document provides a specific rule for classifying a single mixed-use property for loan origination purposes. The related documents address different subjects, such as an institution's own property investment limits, the valuation and monitoring of collateral value, risk-weighting of real estate exposures, or rules for exposures secured by multiple distinct properties. Since no two excerpts govern the exact same regulatory subject, actor, and action, no overlaps or contradictions can be identified.",
