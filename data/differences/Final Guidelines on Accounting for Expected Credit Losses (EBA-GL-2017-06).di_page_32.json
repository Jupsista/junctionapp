  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found. The documents address different regulatory subjects. The primary document details model validation requirements for Expected Credit Loss (ECL) accounting models. The related documents discuss model validation for different purposes, such as for Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB), loan origination, the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach for capital, and Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR). As these rules apply to different types of models and distinct regulatory contexts, they do not govern the same regulatory subject and therefore do not create an overlap or contradiction.",
