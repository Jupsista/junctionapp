  "summary": "One overlap was identified between the 'Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring' and the 'Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for SREP'. Both require that institutions' credit risk policies and procedures address the identification, assessment, and management of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks arising from credit granting activities. The former establishes the general requirement, while the latter specifies the details that policies and procedures should contain, creating a direct overlap on the same regulatory subject for the same actors.",
