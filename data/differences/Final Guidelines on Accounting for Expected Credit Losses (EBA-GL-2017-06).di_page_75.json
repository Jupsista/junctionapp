  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found between the provided texts. The primary document discusses the application of materiality and proportionality principles in the context of accounting for expected credit losses (ECL). The related documents discuss similar principles but in different regulatory contexts, such as stress testing or the management of non-performing exposures, or they concern the role of supervisors rather than the direct obligations of institutions. Therefore, they do not regulate the same regulatory subject under the strict definitions provided.",
