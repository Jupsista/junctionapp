The EBA Guidelines mandate that the assessment should be carried out at both the individual and group level. Similarly, the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority's guidelines list the 'group of connected clients' and its obligations as a mandatory factor to be considered in credit decisions. This represents a true overlap as both texts impose a similar requirement on the same actor (financial institutions) for the same regulatory action (credit assessment).",
