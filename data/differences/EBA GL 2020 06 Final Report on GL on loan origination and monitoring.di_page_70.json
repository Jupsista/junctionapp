  "summary": "The provided texts regulate different subjects. The EBA text sets out criteria for institutions' internal policies on loan origination for shipping finance, focusing on prudent credit risk management. The Basel Framework text, while also applying to banks and mentioning ship financing (as object finance), sets rules for assigning regulatory risk weights for capital adequacy purposes. These are different regulatory actions (loan origination vs. capital calculation) in different functional contexts (credit risk management vs. capital adequacy). The other documents concern unrelated topics such as state aid, environmental regulations, and international sanctions. As the mandatory 'same regulatory subject' condition is not met for any pair of documents, no overlaps or contradictions can be identified.",
