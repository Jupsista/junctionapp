  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found between the analyzed documents. The source document, from the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring, outlines high-level responsibilities for credit institutions in areas such as credit risk monitoring, stress testing, and management of non-performing exposures. The related documents either provide more detailed, complementary guidance on these same topics (often explicitly referenced by the source document), or they outline the responsibilities of a different actor (competent authorities) in assessing institutions' compliance with these requirements. As the texts either apply to different actors or are designed to be complementary rather than divergent, they do not regulate the same subject in a conflicting or overlapping manner.",
