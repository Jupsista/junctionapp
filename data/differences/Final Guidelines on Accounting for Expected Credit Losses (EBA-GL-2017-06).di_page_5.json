  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found between the provided texts. The main document describes the EBA Guidelines on Accounting for Expected Credit Losses (ECL). Several related documents reference these specific guidelines, but they do so to incorporate them by reference for specific contexts (such as for Non-Performing Exposures) or as part of a national implementation. This constitutes a regulatory hierarchy or application, not a case of divergent rules governing the same subject. Other documents touched upon related themes like credit risk or IFRS 9 but addressed different regulatory subjects, such as the prudential definition of default or supervisory procedures, failing the 'same regulatory subject' test.",
