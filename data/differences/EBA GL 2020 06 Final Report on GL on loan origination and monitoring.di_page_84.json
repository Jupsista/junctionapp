  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found. The primary document is a summary of feedback from a public consultation on draft guidelines for loan origination. It does not contain any operative rules, obligations, or requirements. Therefore, it cannot overlap with or contradict other regulatory texts, which do contain such rules. The compared texts discuss thematically related topics such as non-performing exposures, credit risk, and other EBA guidelines, but do not meet the strict criteria for a direct rule-level comparison as the primary text is non-binding and descriptive of a consultation process.",
