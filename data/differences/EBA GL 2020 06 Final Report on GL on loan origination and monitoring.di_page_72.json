  "summary": "The analysis identified three overlaps between the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring and the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). Both texts impose requirements on credit institutions regarding collateral for loans to enterprises. Specifically, they overlap on the requirements for ensuring collateral is properly insured, valued, and legally enforceable. The EBA Guidelines frame these as information to be collected at the loan origination stage, while the CRR establishes them as ongoing procedural requirements and conditions for the collateral to be eligible for credit risk mitigation purposes. These are divergent but consistent rules governing the same regulatory subject.",
