  "summary": "One contradiction was identified where a national competent authority (the Finnish FIN-FSA) directs its supervised entities to comply with the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring, but explicitly excludes a specific paragraph (paragraph 93 of Chapter 5) from this compliance obligation for consumer loans. This creates a direct conflict between the EU-level guideline which expects full compliance and the national-level instruction which carves out a specific provision for the same regulatory subject and actor.",
