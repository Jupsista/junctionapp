  "summary": "The user-provided texts were compared to identify potential overlaps and contradictions in regulatory requirements. The primary document is a summary of feedback from a public consultation on EBA guidelines concerning expected credit losses. The related documents cover various topics, including public consultations for other EBA guidelines (e.g., on non-performing exposures, loan origination), and sections of IFRS 9. The analysis found no true overlaps or contradictions because the primary text is descriptive and non-operative; it summarizes stakeholder feedback rather than imposing, modifying, or defining any legal obligations or rules. This type of content is explicitly excluded from comparison for overlaps or contradictions as it does not contain operative requirements.",
