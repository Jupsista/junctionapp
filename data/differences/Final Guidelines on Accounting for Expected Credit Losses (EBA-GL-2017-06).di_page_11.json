  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found. The provided documents reference each other to create a cohesive regulatory framework rather than presenting divergent rules on the same subject. Specifically, the 'Guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne exposures' and national Finnish regulations explicitly refer to and require compliance with the 'Guidelines on credit institutions' credit risk management practices and accounting for expected credit losses' (EBA/GL/2017/06). This indicates a hierarchical or complementary relationship between the texts, not an overlap or contradiction of rules governing the same regulatory subject.",
