  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found. The original text describes the policy options considered when drafting the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring, specifically whether they should apply to new loans only or to existing loans as well. This text is part of the rationale and is non-operative. The related texts either refer to these guidelines in a different context (e.g., for supervisory assessment by competent authorities under SREP) or discuss different regulatory subjects (e.g., management of non-performing exposures, collateral eligibility). No two texts regulate the same subject matter by imposing conflicting or overlapping requirements on the same actor.",
