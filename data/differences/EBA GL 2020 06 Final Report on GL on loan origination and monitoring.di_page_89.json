  "summary": "One contradiction was identified between the EBA's principle-based approach to loan pricing and a national regulator's specific recommendations. The EBA Guidelines on Loan Origination and Monitoring (summarized in the first document) explicitly state that the intention is not to prescribe specific pricing strategies, thereby allowing institutions discretion. In contrast, the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority's guidelines provide specific numerical parameters (a minimum interest rate of 6% and a maximum loan maturity of 25 years) to be used in the affordability calculation for new housing loans. This prescription of fixed numerical thresholds for a key component of the lending decision contradicts the discretionary, principle-based approach set out by the EBA.",
