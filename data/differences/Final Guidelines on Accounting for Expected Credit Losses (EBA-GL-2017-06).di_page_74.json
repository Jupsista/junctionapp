  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found between the provided texts. The source document discusses the application of the proportionality principle for credit risk management and expected credit loss accounting. The related documents cover different regulatory topics such as the Basel framework on credit risk, the Capital Requirements Regulation's definition of default, and EBA guidelines on non-performing exposures, loan origination, and stress testing. While some documents also mention proportionality, they apply it to their own distinct regulatory subjects, not to the same subject as the source document. Therefore, the strict criteria for an overlap or contradiction are not met.",
