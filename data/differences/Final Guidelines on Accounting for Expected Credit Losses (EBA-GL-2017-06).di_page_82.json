  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found. The primary document consists of a summary of stakeholder comments and the EBA's analysis regarding draft guidelines on disclosures for expected credit losses. This content is non-operative, describing the rationale and relationship with other frameworks like IFRS 7, rather than imposing specific, concrete legal requirements. The related documents contain operative rules from IFRS or other EBA guidelines on different regulatory subjects (e.g., definition of default, NPE management). A comparison between non-operative rationale and operative rules, or between texts on different regulatory subjects, is not possible under the provided definitions.",
