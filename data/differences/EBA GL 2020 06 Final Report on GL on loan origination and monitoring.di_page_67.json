  "summary": "An overlap was identified between two EBA Guidelines concerning the monitoring of borrowers with increased credit risk. Both sets of guidelines require credit institutions to implement more frequent review processes for borrowers who trigger early warning indicators or are placed on a watch list. This constitutes an overlap as both texts impose the same procedural requirement on the same actors for the same regulatory purpose.",

      "pageNumber2": 44,
      "explanation": "Both guidelines impose the same requirement on credit institutions regarding the monitoring of borrowers that show signs of increased credit risk. One guideline states that triggering 'Early Warning Indicators (EWIs)' should lead to an 'increased frequency in the reviewing process,' while the other states that for 'borrowers on a watch list or with a weak rating,' 'more frequent review processes should be in place.' These are functionally equivalent requirements addressing the same regulatory subject and action: intensifying monitoring for at-risk borrowers.",
