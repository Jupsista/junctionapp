  "summary": "One overlap was identified between the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring and a FIN-FSA guideline on credit risk management. Both texts specify the required components of a credit institution's credit risk strategy or appetite, covering similar aspects such as portfolio composition, diversification, and target markets. These are divergent but similar rules governing the same regulatory subject for the same actor type.",

      "explanation": "Both texts impose requirements on institutions regarding the content of their credit risk strategy or appetite. They both mandate that this strategy must define the composition and diversification of the credit portfolio, specifying similar dimensions such as economic sectors, geographical locations, and diversification principles. The rules govern the same regulatory subject (content of the credit risk strategy) for the same actor (credit institutions) and are highly similar, constituting an overlap.",
