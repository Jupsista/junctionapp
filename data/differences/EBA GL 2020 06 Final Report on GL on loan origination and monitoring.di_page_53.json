  "summary": "One overlap was identified between the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and a Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority regulation. Both texts require institutions to use internationally recognised valuation standards when assessing collateral. The other provided texts were found to address different regulatory subjects, such as the valuation of collateral for non-performing exposures or for specific capital requirement calculation approaches (e.g., IRB), rather than the general requirements for valuation at the point of loan origination, thus not meeting the criteria for an overlap or contradiction.",

This constitutes an overlap as they govern the same regulatory subject (collateral valuation standards), apply to the same type of actor (financial institutions), and impose the same requirement (adherence to international standards).",
