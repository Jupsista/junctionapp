Both the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring and the EBA Guidelines on the management of non-performing and forborne exposures stipulate that statistical models cannot be used as the sole means for reviewing property valuations.

      "explanation": "Both documents establish the same rule for credit institutions regarding the use of statistical models for the valuation of immovable property collateral. The Final Report on loan origination guidelines summarizes the existing regulatory landscape, including the rule from the CRR, which prohibits statistical models from being the sole means of valuation review. The Guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne exposures contain the direct, operative rule with the identical prohibition. This is an overlap as both texts govern the same actor, regulatory subject, and impose the same requirement.",
