  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found. The primary document is a table of contents and does not contain any operative legal text that could be compared with the related documents. The related documents, while touching upon similar themes like collateral valuation and loan origination, either explicitly reference and implement the guidelines from the main document's larger text, apply to different actors (such as competent authorities instead of credit institutions), or operate in different functional contexts (e.g., capital requirements, covered bonds, central bank operations). Therefore, the mandatory condition of regulating the 'same regulatory subject' is not met for any comparison.",
