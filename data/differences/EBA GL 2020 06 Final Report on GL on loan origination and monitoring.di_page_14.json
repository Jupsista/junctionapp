  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found between the documents. The primary document, the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring, establishes specific rules for institutions regarding performing loans. The related documents either reference these guidelines as a basis for supervisory assessment (e.g., SREP guidelines), address different stages of the credit lifecycle (e.g., guidelines on non-performing exposures, which are explicitly carved out of the primary document's scope), or represent national-level implementation that incorporates the EBA guidelines by reference. In all cases, the documents regulate different subjects, actors, or actions, and do not present divergent or conflicting rules for the same regulatory requirement.",
