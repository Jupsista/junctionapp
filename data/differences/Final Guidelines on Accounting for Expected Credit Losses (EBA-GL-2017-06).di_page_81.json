  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found between the provided texts. The primary document discusses the EBA's interpretation of the independence requirements for model validation and development functions, stating that its guidelines are consistent with the CRR. The other documents either lay out the high-level principles that the EBA guidelines interpret (without creating a divergence), concern different regulatory actions such as public disclosure of model governance, or address entirely different regulatory subjects like credit risk mitigation or disclosure of prudential metrics. Therefore, the mandatory condition of addressing the 'same regulatory subject' with divergent rules is not met.",
