  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found. The primary document contains the conclusion of a cost-benefit analysis for guidelines on credit risk management and accounting for expected credit losses. This type of content, which describes legislative rationale rather than imposing specific operative requirements, is excluded from comparison. The related documents are either similar cost-benefit analyses for different regulatory subjects (such as outsourcing, loan origination, or suitability assessments) or are otherwise unrelated. Therefore, the mandatory condition of addressing the same regulatory subject is not met between the primary document and any of the related texts.",
