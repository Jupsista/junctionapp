  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found between the provided texts. The primary document outlines high-level principles for loan origination, specifically defining 'source of repayment capacity' and the 'proportionality' principle for applying the guidelines. The related documents, while touching upon credit risk and borrower assessment, address different regulatory subjects. These include capital requirements for specific lending types (e.g., specialised lending, real estate), management of non-performing exposures, accounting for expected credit losses, and the supervisory review process (SREP). None of the compared texts regulate the exact same requirements for the general process of loan origination and monitoring, thus failing the 'same regulatory subject' test.",
