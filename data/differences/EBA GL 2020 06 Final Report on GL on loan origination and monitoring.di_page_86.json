  "summary": "The primary document summarizes industry feedback on the draft EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring, focusing on concerns about proportionality, level of detail, and implementation timelines. It does not contain operative legal requirements. The related documents cover various topics such as supervisory review (SREP), non-performing exposures, outsourcing, and connected clients. Since the primary document is descriptive of a consultation process and does not impose specific rules, it does not share the same regulatory subject with any of the operative rules in the related documents. Therefore, no overlaps or contradictions can be identified.",
