  "summary": "The analysis found no overlaps or contradictions between the source document and the provided related content. The documents form a coherent regulatory framework where guidelines on specific topics, such as the management of non-performing exposures, explicitly reference and build upon the foundational guidelines for credit risk management and accounting for expected credit losses. For instance, the guidelines on non-performing exposures repeatedly state that credit institutions should assess loss allowances and apply write-off policies 'in accordance with the EBA Guidelines on credit risk management practices and accounting for expected credit losses'. This demonstrates a hierarchical and complementary relationship, not a divergent or conflicting one.",
