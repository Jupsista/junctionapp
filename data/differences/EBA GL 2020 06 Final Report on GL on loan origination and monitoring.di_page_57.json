The primary document outlines rules for the valuation of movable property collateral in the context of general loan origination and monitoring. The related documents either pertain to a different regulatory subject, such as the valuation of immovable property, or address the same subject but within a different functional context, such as the management of non-performing exposures or specific capital requirements calculations (IRB Approach). The rules presented are complementary and do not govern the exact same regulatory subject in a divergent manner.",
