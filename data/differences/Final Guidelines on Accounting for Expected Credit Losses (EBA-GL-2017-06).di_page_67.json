  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found. The primary document is a summary of responses to a public consultation on the EBA Guidelines on credit risk management practices and accounting for expected credit losses. It does not contain operative rules itself, but rather discusses the feedback received and the EBA's rationale for the final text. The compared documents either address different regulatory subjects (such as loan origination, stress testing, or non-performing exposures), represent different levels of regulation (such as the underlying IFRS 9 accounting standard or national implementations referencing the EBA guidelines), or are non-binding explanatory texts. Consequently, there is no instance of two documents imposing divergent or contradictory rules on the same specific regulatory subject.",
