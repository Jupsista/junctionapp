  "summary": "The source document is a final report summarizing stakeholder feedback and the EBA's response during the consultation process for the Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring. It does not contain any operative rules or legal requirements. Instead, it describes suggestions, concerns, and requests from the Banking Stakeholder Group regarding the draft guidelines. The related documents consist of other guidelines, regulations, and reports, some of which reference or implement the final version of the EBA Guidelines. As the source document does not impose, modify, or define any obligations, rights, or conditions, it fails to meet the mandatory 'Same Regulatory Subject' test, which requires both texts to be operative. Therefore, no overlaps or contradictions can be identified.",
