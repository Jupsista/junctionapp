  "summary": "The documents do not regulate the same subject matter. The primary document specifies the application date for the EBA Guidelines on Credit Institutions' Credit Risk Management Practices and Accounting for Expected Credit Losses (EBA/GL/2017/06). The related documents either reference these guidelines for substantive purposes, discuss different regulatory topics, or establish application dates for entirely separate sets of guidelines. As the core condition of regulating the 'SAME REGULATORY SUBJECT' is not met, no overlaps or contradictions can be identified.",
