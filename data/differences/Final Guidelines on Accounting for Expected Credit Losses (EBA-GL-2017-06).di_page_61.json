  "summary": "No overlaps or contradictions were found. The documents discuss the principle of proportionality for credit institutions, but each applies it to a different regulatory subject. The original document focuses on proportionality in the context of accounting for expected credit losses and the use of IFRS 9 practical expedients. The related documents discuss proportionality in other contexts, such as the management of non-performing exposures, internal governance, and loan origination. As the specific regulatory actions and functional contexts differ, they do not meet the criteria for an overlap or contradiction.",
