  "summary": "The provided texts do not meet the criteria for an overlap or contradiction. The primary document is a summary of comments and analysis from the European Banking Authority regarding draft guidelines, which is considered non-operative text and legislative rationale. It does not directly impose, modify, or limit obligations. The related texts are from IFRS 9, which the primary document references and discusses. A comparison cannot be made as the primary document does not contain the actual binding rules but rather commentary on their development.",
