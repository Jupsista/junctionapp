  "summary": "A clear overlap exists between the EBA Guidelines on Accounting for Expected Credit Losses and the IFRS 9 standard (as adopted in EU regulation). Both texts mandate the identical procedure for credit institutions/entities to assess whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred for a modified financial asset that has not been derecognised. The procedure requires comparing the risk of default at the reporting date under the new terms with the risk of default at initial recognition under the original terms.",

      "excerpt1": "IFRS 9, in paragraphs 5.5.12 and B5.5.25-B5.5.27, sets out the requirements for the assessment of significant increases in credit risk for lending exposures whose contractual cash flows have been renegotiated or modified. In particular, for modifications that do not result in derecognition in accordance with IFRS 9, an entity must assess whether credit risk has increased significantly by comparing (a) the risk of a default occurring at the reporting date based on the modified contractual terms with (b) the risk of default occurring upon initial recognition based on the original, unmodified contractual terms.",

      "excerpt2": "If the contractual cash flows on a financial asset have been renegotiated or modified and the financial asset was not derecognised, an entity shall assess whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk of the financial instrument in accordance with paragraph 5.5.3 by comparing: (a) the risk of a default occurring at the reporting date (based on the modified contractual terms); and (b) the risk of a default occurring at initial recognition (based on the original, unmodified contractual terms).",

      "explanation": "Both texts regulate the same subject: the method for assessing a significant increase in credit risk for a modified financial asset that is not derecognised. They apply to the same actors (credit institutions/entities applying IFRS 9) and impose the exact same procedural requirement, which is to compare the risk of default at the reporting date under the modified terms with the risk of default at initial recognition under the original terms. The EBA Guideline directly refers to and reiterates the requirement from IFRS 9.",
