  "summary": "The documents do not regulate the same subject matter under the provided definitions. The original document is a cost-benefit analysis for the EBA Guidelines on accounting for expected credit losses (ECL). The related documents are either cost-benefit analyses for different guidelines (e.g., on outsourcing, suitability of management, IRRBB/CSRBB), guidelines on different topics (e.g., management of non-performing exposures, loan origination) that cross-reference the ECL guidelines without creating new rules on the same subject, or are otherwise unrelated. Therefore, no true overlaps or contradictions were found.",
