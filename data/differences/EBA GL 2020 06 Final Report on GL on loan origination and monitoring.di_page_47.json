  "summary": "The provided texts do not meet the criteria for an overlap or contradiction. The original document sets out specific procedural requirements for institutions when conducting a creditworthiness assessment for lending in real estate development, including checks on business plans, cost contingencies, and on-site visits. The related documents discuss different regulatory subjects, such as the supervisory assessment of real estate investment risk by competent authorities, the definition of specialized lending categories for risk-weighting purposes, or high-level requirements for managing the risk of excessive leverage at the firm-wide level. None of the compared texts regulate the same specific action (creditworthiness assessment process for real estate development loans) for the same actor type (institutions) in the same functional context (loan origination).",
